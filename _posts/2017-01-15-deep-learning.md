It was found that **Multilayer Fully Connected Neural Networks** are not ideal for image processing needs. One of the main problems is that their structure doesn't have any means to capture the fundamental two-dimensional property of image data. Due to a high complexity of **Fully Connected Neural Network**, it is very difficult to train **Deep Neural Networks** for even small images. Complexity and computational demand grows exponentially with size of input data. For this reason there was developed new model of neural networks called **Convolutional Neural Networks**.
