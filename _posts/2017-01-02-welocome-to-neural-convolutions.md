Hi, my name is Ondrej Zapletal and I'm in my final year of masters degree at [The Faculty of Electrical Engineering](http://www.feec.vutbr.cz/fakulta/home.php?lang=en) in [Brno University of Technology](https://www.vutbr.cz/en/). More specifically in department of Cybernetics, Control and Measurements.

The subject of my master thesis is 'Image Recognition by Convolutional Neural Networks - Basic Concepts'

I'm interested in machine learning for quite some time and specifically in Neural Networks. I'm also interested in human cognition.

I'm not particularly familiar with Convolutional Neural Networks. For this reason I've decided to create this blog to help me document my journey to deeper understanding of  Deep Learning world. I'm planning to use some of these blog posts as chapters in my thesis so I can effectively use my effort for

> I was first exposed to Machine learning in 2014 by watching videos of Nando de Freitas, who is currently professor at Oxford University. I must recommend his [youtube ](https://www.youtube.com/user/ProfNandoDF) channel.

#### Currently I have plan to cover following topics:

* Neural networks in general

* Back-propagation

* Convolution

* GPGU

* Python for machine learning


> Let me know in comments bellow if you have any special wishes for future subjects.
