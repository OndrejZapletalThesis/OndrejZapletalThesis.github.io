I'm last year student of Cybernetics, Control and Measurements department. I'm finishing my thesis on Convolutional Neural Networks and for long time I'm interested in Neural networks in general. One of my interests is human cognition human intelligence. Basis for human conciseness and other.

#### Currently I have plan to cover following topics:

+ Neural networks in general what they are good for and what not.

+ Back-propagation

+ Convolution

+ GPGU

+ Python for machine learning


> Let me know bellow in comments if you have any ideas what you want to discuss.
